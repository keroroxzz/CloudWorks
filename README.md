INSTALL
---------------------------------

1. install enb for GTA SA frome http://enbdev.com/mod_gtasa_v0430.htm.
2. unpack d3d9.dll, enblocal.ini, enbseries.ini, and enbseries folder in the WrapperVersion.
3. put the files fo CloudWorks (png, fx, and ini) inside enbseries folder.
4. open the game and wait for compiling.
5. you get a sky with cloud!

note : you need to tweak the UseOriginalPostProcessing and UseOriginalColorCorrection to get a better look.

NOTICE
---------------------------------

If you just cover up the original enblighting.fx file, the effect, such as shadow and lighting inside the file, will disappear, too.
So you have to mix the two shaders by yourself.
