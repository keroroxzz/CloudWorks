This is the alpha version of the CloudWorks.
Atmosphere and weather still need to be improved.

GTX 1660s or better graphic card is needed to run this stuff at 1080p.

INSTALL

1. install enb for GTA SA.
2. put the files inside enbseries.

NOTIC

If you just cover up the original enblighting.fx file, the effect, such as shadow and lighting inside the file, will disappear, too.
So you have to mix the two shaders by yourself.
